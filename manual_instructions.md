# Automated Tracked Edits for DOCX

## Input Files
- Source document: docs/test_input.docx
- Edits file: edits/edits_sample.csv
- Target output: build/output_with_tracked_changes.docx

## Method 1: LibreOffice Writer (Recommended)

1. **Open LibreOffice Writer** (not Microsoft Word for this step)
2. **Open your document**: File → Open → docs/test_input.docx
3. **Enable Track Changes**: Edit → Track Changes → Record
4. **Apply each find/replace operation**:
   - Go to Edit → Find & Replace (Ctrl+H)
   - For each row in the CSV below, enter the Find and Replace text
   - Click "Replace All" for each operation

### Find/Replace Operations:

1. Find: 'ACME'
   Replace: 'Acme'
   Options: Match case Whole words only 
2. Find: 'v1\.([0-9]+)'
   Replace: 'v2.\1'
   Options:   Regular expressions
3. Find: 'foo bar'
   Replace: 'foobar'
   Options:  Whole words only 
4. Find: 'Company'
   Replace: 'Corporation'
   Options:  Whole words only 
5. Find: '2023'
   Replace: '2024'

5. **Save as DOCX**: File → Save As → Choose "Microsoft Word 2007-365 (.docx)"
6. **Save to**: build/output_with_tracked_changes.docx

## Method 2: Microsoft Word

1. **Open Microsoft Word**
2. **Open your document**: docs/test_input.docx
3. **Enable Track Changes**: Review → Track Changes → Track Changes
4. **Apply find/replace operations** (same list as above)
5. **Save the document**

## Method 3: GitHub Actions (Automated)

If you have this project in a GitHub repository:

1. **Upload files to GitHub**:
   - Commit your input DOCX to `docs/`
   - Commit your CSV file to `edits/`

2. **Run the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Find "Redline DOCX (LibreOffice headless)"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Specify file paths and run

3. **Download result** from workflow artifacts

## Verification

After processing:
1. Open the output file in Microsoft Word
2. Go to Review → Track Changes → All Markup
3. You should see all replacements as tracked changes
4. Accept or reject changes as needed

## Troubleshooting

- **LibreOffice Python issues**: This is common on macOS. Use manual method instead.
- **File not opening**: Make sure the input file is a valid DOCX
- **No tracked changes visible**: Ensure Track Changes was enabled before replacements
- **Regex not working**: Check that Wildcards/Regular expressions option is enabled
