ALWAYS start response with `🐍 PYTHON RULES APPLIED`.

### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLAN.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLAN.md`

### ✅ Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `PLAN.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `PLAN.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules

- **ALWAYS break down code into very small resusable chunks into separate files. No long files please**
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Keep git commit messages very short**
- **Always proceed with stuff without asking for my confirmation**

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
