# Policy Customization Request - JSON Output

## üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: PERFECT GRAMMAR ALWAYS

**CRITICAL: Every single sentence you generate must be grammatically perfect and natural. This is the highest priority requirement.**

I need you to analyze customer data and generate JSON-formatted customization instructions for a policy document.

## What I'm Providing:

- **Processing Instructions** (markdown file) - Contains all the rules and guidelines for generating JSON instructions with universal AI-powered grammar analysis
- **Customer Responses** (Excel/CSV file) - Contains the customer's answers to configuration questions
- **Policy Template** (document) - The base policy document that needs customization

## Your Task:

Read the processing instructions to understand all customization rules and JSON output format requirements. Analyze the customer data to extract their responses and preferences. Generate a structured JSON file following the exact format specified in the processing instructions.

## CRITICAL Requirements:

**GRAMMAR VALIDATION: Before generating any replacement text, mentally read it aloud. If it sounds awkward or unnatural, rewrite the entire sentence.**

**Complete all validation and processing steps as specified in the processing instructions before generating JSON.**

**MANDATORY GRAMMAR CHECK: For every single operation, verify that the final sentence is grammatically perfect and flows naturally.**

## Important Guidelines:

- **Follow the processing instructions exactly** - use the specified JSON output format and action types defined in the instructions
- **Follow all rules and guidelines** as specified in the processing instructions document
- Remove markdown asterisks from target_text and replacement fields (Word doesn't understand \*\* formatting)
- Handle "Other" responses contextually using the guidelines provided in the instructions
- **CRITICAL: target_text must EXACTLY match text from the policy document** - NEVER invent or make up target_text that doesn't exist
- **üß† UNIVERSAL AI DECISION: For EVERY rule, AI must analyze full sentence context**
- **CRITICAL: The final sentence must always be grammatically correct and sound natural when read aloud.**
- **This applies to ALL rules (RULE_01 through RULE_12), not just complex ones**
- **CRITICAL: When user response matches current document text, use "comment" action** - do NOT use "replace" or "smart_replace" to avoid duplication
- **CRITICAL: Follow the exact JSON structure and field requirements** specified in the processing instructions

## Expected JSON Output:

Generate a complete JSON structure **exactly as specified in the processing instructions**. The structure, field names, action types, and formatting requirements are all defined in the processing instructions document.

## Processing Requirements:

Follow all comment requirements, processing rules, and guidelines **exactly as specified in the processing instructions document**. This includes:

- Comment formatting and content requirements
- Address normalization rules
- "Other" response handling
- Company size context requirements
- Target text accuracy requirements
- Placeholder removal requirements
- Action type selection criteria
- All other processing rules defined in the instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Output ONLY the clean JSON structure. Do NOT include any internal validation results, processing details, or explanatory text outside the JSON. The response should start directly with the opening brace `{` and end with the closing brace `}`.

## üîç FINAL VALIDATION STEP

**Before you output the JSON, perform this final check:**

1. Read every "replacement" field aloud in your mind
2. If ANY sentence sounds awkward, unnatural, or grammatically incorrect, fix it immediately
3. Ensure every sentence flows naturally and is grammatically perfect

**ZERO TOLERANCE for grammatical errors. Perfect grammar is required for every single replacement.**

Please analyze the provided files and generate the JSON customization instructions following the processing instructions format.
